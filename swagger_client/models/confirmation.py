    trustshare API

    Welcome to the trustshare API Reference documentation. Here you can find detailed information about the endpoints we provide as well as the shape of entities within the system.  # Environments The trustshare API has two environments, __Sandbox__ and __Live__. Both environments are available under the same endpoint however API Keys and client secrets are prefixed with the environment name. - A __Sandbox__ API Key will be in the format: `sandbox_api_[0-9a-z]`. - A __Live__ API Key will be in the format: `live_api_[0-9a-z]`.  ## Sandbox Our __Sandbox__ environment endeavours to be as close to the __Live__ environment as possible, however, there are a couple of limitations and features which should be noted. - Card payments take around 7 days to settle into accounts. In __Live__ this is generally closer to 2 days. - Manual inbound payments can only be \"faked\" in __Sandbox__ when they are less-than or equal-to `250,000.00`. - Open Banking in __Sandbox__ will always use a \"Mock Bank\" UI to accept the payment.  # noqa: E501
